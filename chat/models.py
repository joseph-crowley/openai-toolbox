This Django module defines the data models for the application.

The models defined in this module will be used to create and manage the database schema
and interact with the database through Django's ORM. The models should be defined as
subclasses of `django.db.models.Model` and include the necessary fields as instances
of the appropriate Django field classes.

Related files and dependencies:
- django.db: Provides the base `Model` class and field classes for defining the data models
- settings.py: Specifies the database configuration and other project settings
- views.py: Contains the business logic for the application, which may interact with the models defined in this module
- admin.py: Configures the Django admin site to manage the models defined in this module

Key implementation details:
1. Import the `models` module from `django.db` to define the data models
2. Create classes for each table in the database, inheriting from `models.Model`
3. Add fields to each class, specifying the appropriate field types and options, such as `max_length`, `null`, and `default`
4. Include any required relationships between models, such as ForeignKey, OneToOneField, or ManyToManyField
5. Define any custom methods or properties on the models to encapsulate business logic or computed attributes

Additional information:
- To create and apply the initial database migration, run `python manage.py makemigrations` followed by `python manage.py migrate`
- To interact with the models using Django's ORM, refer to the official Django documentation: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/db/models/
- To customize the way models are displayed in the admin site, refer to the official Django documentation: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/contrib/admin/
- For best practices on structuring your models, refer to the official Django documentation: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/misc/design-philosophies/#models
