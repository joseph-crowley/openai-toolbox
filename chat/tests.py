Django Test Module
==================

This module provides the necessary structure for writing and organizing test
cases for a Django application. The primary purpose of this code is to serve as
an entry point for writing test cases and ensure they are executed correctly
by the Django testing framework.

Dependencies:
-------------
- django.test.TestCase: A base class for creating test cases that is a subclass
  of Python's built-in unittest.TestCase. It provides a set of methods and
  assertions specifically designed to work with the Django framework.

Related Files:
--------------
- settings.py: Contains the configuration settings for the Django project,
  including the 'TEST_RUNNER' setting which specifies the test runner to be
  used for running tests.
- urls.py: Contains the URL routing configuration for the Django project. Test
  cases will often need to reference and interact with this configuration.
- views.py: Contains view functions or classes for the Django project. Test
  cases will be created to test the logic and behavior of these views.
- models.py: Contains the database models for the Django project. Test cases
  may be created to test model methods or model managers.
- forms.py: Contains form classes for the Django project. Test cases may be
  created to test form validation and processing logic.

Key Implementation Details:
---------------------------
- To write a test case, create a new class that inherits from
  django.test.TestCase, and define test methods within that class. Test methods
  should start with the word 'test' in their names.
- Django's TestCase class provides several useful assertion methods specific to
  testing Django components, such as assertContains, assertNotContains,
  assertRedirects and assertTemplateUsed, among others.
- Test cases can also make use of Django's test client to simulate requests
  and interactions with views, as well as the setUp and tearDown methods to
  set up and clean up test data for each test method.

Additional Information:
-----------------------
- Django's testing framework can be run using the command 'python manage.py test'.
  This command will discover and execute all test cases within the project.
- Consider creating separate test modules for each Django app within the project
  to keep tests organized and modular.
- For more advanced testing needs, Django supports integration with third-party
  testing tools such as pytest and factory_boy.
