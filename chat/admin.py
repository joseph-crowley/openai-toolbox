Django Admin Configuration
--------------------------

This code is responsible for registering your Django application's models to the Django admin interface. This allows you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on your models through the Django admin page, which is useful for managing your application's data.

Related Files and Dependencies
------------------------------
- `models.py` file in your Django application: Contains the models you will register to the Django admin.
- Django admin module: Imported using `from django.contrib import admin` at the beginning of this file.

Key Implementation Details
--------------------------
To register a model, follow these steps:

1. Import the model:
   Add an import statement at the top of the file for each model you want to register. The import statement should be in the format:
   `from .models import YourModelName`

2. Register the model with the admin site:
   Add the following line for each model you want to register:
   `admin.site.register(YourModelName)`

   Replace `YourModelName` with the name of the model you are registering.

Example
-------
Suppose you have a model named `BlogPost` in your `models.py` file. Your code should look like this:

    from django.contrib import admin
    from .models import BlogPost

    # Register your models here.
    admin.site.register(BlogPost)

Additional Information
----------------------
- To customize the way a model appears in the Django admin, you can create a custom ModelAdmin class for that model. Refer to the Django documentation for more details: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/contrib/admin/#modeladmin-objects

- Make sure your Django application is included in the 'INSTALLED_APPS' setting in your Django project's settings.py file, so that the Django admin can discover and display your registered models.

- Ensure that the 'django.contrib.admin' app is also included in the 'INSTALLED_APPS' setting in your Django project's settings.py file for the Django admin functionality to work.
