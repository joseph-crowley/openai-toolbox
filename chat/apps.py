ChatConfig: A Django AppConfig class for the 'chat' app.

The main purpose and functionality of this code is to configure the 'chat' app
for the Django project. It extends the AppConfig class provided by the Django framework
and sets the 'name' attribute to 'chat' to identify the app.

Related files and dependencies:
- Django AppConfig is imported from django.apps module
- This class should be located within the 'apps.py' file of the 'chat' app
- The 'chat' app should be included in the INSTALLED_APPS of the Django project settings

Location of key implementation details:
- The class ChatConfig extends AppConfig, which is provided by Django
- The only implementation detail here is the assignment of the 'name' attribute
  to the string 'chat'

Additional information essential for understanding and maintaining the code:
- If you need to add or update any configuration for the 'chat' app, you can do it within
  this ChatConfig class
- If the name of the app needs to be changed, update the 'name' attribute accordingly and
  also update the app name in the Django project settings
- If additional apps are created within the project, each app should have its own AppConfig
  class with a unique name
