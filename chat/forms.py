This code defines a Django Form named InputForm, which is a simple form consisting of a single input field
for users to enter text-based messages. The main purpose of this form is to provide a structured way to
collect user input and validate it before further processing.

Related Files and Dependencies:
1. Django (https://www.djangoproject.com/): This code relies on the Django web framework, specifically the `forms` module.
2. You may also find the template HTML file and view function where this form is rendered and processed respectively.
   Usually, these will be located within the project's templates and views directories.

Key Implementation Details:
1. The form class is a subclass of `forms.Form` from Django, which is the base class for all Django forms.
2. The `user_input` field is defined as a CharField with a maximum length of 1024 characters. The field has a
   label ('Enter your message:') that will be displayed alongside the input field when rendered in an HTML template.

Additional Information:
1. When the form is submitted, it is important to validate the user input for security reasons and ensure the entered
   message adheres to the maximum length constraint. This validation is automatically performed by Django when calling
   the `is_valid()` method on an instance of InputForm.
2. In the views.py file, you will typically import this form, create an instance of it, and render it in the context
   of an HTML template. When the form is submitted, the view will receive the POST data, validate the form, and
   process the user input accordingly.
3. For more information on Django forms, see the official Django documentation:
   https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/forms/
