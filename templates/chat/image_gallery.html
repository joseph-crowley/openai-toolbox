Image Gallery Template

1. Main Purpose and Functionality:

    This code is a Django template for creating an image gallery web page. It extends a base template (base.html) and
    renders the content of the gallery using a provided data set (image_data). The gallery displays each image with its
    respective title, which is derived from the image file name. This template is designed to work seamlessly with the
    Django web framework, allowing for easy integration and customization.

2. Related Files and Dependencies:

    - base.html: The base template that this template extends. It should include standard structure, head, and body
      elements, as well as a {% block content %} tag to allow for content injection.
    - image_data: A list of tuples containing image URLs and file names. This data is iterated over and used to
      generate the gallery items.
    - Django web framework: This template is designed to work with Django, so it requires Django to be installed
      and configured properly.

3. Location of Key Implementation Details:

    - {% block content %}: The main content block where the gallery content is generated and inserted.
    - {% for image_url, image_file in image_data %}: The loop that iterates over the image_data and generates the
      gallery items.
    - {{ image_url }}: The image URL used as the source for the <img> element.
    - {{ image_file|cut:".png"|cut:".jpg"|cut:".jpeg"|cut:".gif" }}: The template filter that removes the file
      extension from the image file name to display it as the gallery item's title.

4. Additional Information:

    This template can be customized further by modifying the HTML structure, CSS classes, or Django template tags.
    Please ensure that any changes made are compatible with the Django web framework and the rest of your application's
    components.
