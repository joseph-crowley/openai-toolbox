OpenAI Toolbox - Home Template

This template file is responsible for rendering the home page of the OpenAI Toolbox web application. It provides an
overview of the key features offered by the application and showcases a selection of images generated by DALL-E.

Related files and dependencies:
- base.html: This is the base template that the current template extends. It provides the common structure and layout
  for all the pages in the application.
- views.py: Contains the view function that supplies the 'panel_images' context variable used in this template.
- urls.py: Defines the URL routing for the application, including the mapping of the home page to the view function.
- models.py: Contains the models related to the application, including the 'Image' model used to store DALL-E-generated
  images.

Key implementation details:

1. Extending the base template:
   The template starts by extending 'base.html', which provides the fundamental layout and structure of the page. This
   allows the home page to inherit the required elements, such as navigation, footer, and styling.

2. Loading static files:
   The "{% load static %}" tag is used to enable the loading of static files. This is required when using the static
   files in the project.

3. Content block:
   The main content of the home page is enclosed within the "{% block content %}" and "{% endblock %}" tags. This is
   the area that will be inserted into the 'content' block of the base template.

4. Feature overview:
   The template provides an overview of the key features offered by the application, such as engaging AI-powered
   conversations, image generation with DALL-E, saved conversations, and an image gallery. These features are
   presented in a list with additional descriptive text.

5. DALL-E-generated image showcase:
   The template displays a set of DALL-E generated images in a grid format. The images are sourced from the
   'panel_images' context variable provided by the view function. The template uses a for loop to iterate over the
   'panel_images' queryset and generate the appropriate HTML for each image.

Additional information:

- CSS classes used in this template are part of the project's stylesheet and are not included in this file. Refer to
  the project's CSS files for styling information.
- The actual content of the application's features, such as AI conversations or image generation, is not part
